#initialise repository
git init

#create username and user email
git config --global user.name "username123"
git config --global user.email "useremail@nhs.net"

#add files manually to local folder, then add to repo
git add .

#check the status of the files, do they need to be committed?
git status

#commit the files to the repo and leave a message
git commit -m "First Files Committed"

#check that your working branch is clean
git status

#create another branch to make changes to a document outside the main branch, and move to that branch
git checkout -b edit_branch

#check which branch you're on
git branch

#make edits to your chosen file, and check the status of the branch
git status

#add those changes to be tracked
git add .

#commit those changes to this branch 
git commit -m "first edit"

#move back to main branch, and see in the chosen file, that nothing has changed. This is because it is solely on the edit_branch
git checkout master

#If you want to merge this change with the main branch, you must be on the master branch
git merge edit_branch

#check the status of the branch
git status

#check the version control log
git log

#manually check the file to see if the changes have been made to the main document, then look to push this to your GitHub remote repo
git push master origin https://github.com/username123/File_Name.git

#check GitHub repo to see if the master has been pushed, and then push your other branch if you like
git push first_edit
